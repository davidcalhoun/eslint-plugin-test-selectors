-   ❌ `<button>Download</button>`
-   ✅ `<button data-test-id="download-button">Download</button>`

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org), which requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (note that `eslint-plugin-test-selectors` requires Node.js 10+):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-test-selectors`:

```
$ npm install eslint-plugin-test-selectors --save-dev
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-test-selectors` globally.

## Usage

Add `test-selectors` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": ["test-selectors"]
}
```

If you want to use all the recommended default rules, you can simply add this line to the `extends` section of your `.eslintrc` configuration:

```json
{
    "extends": ["plugin:test-selectors/recommended"]
}
```

By default, this will run all [Supported Rules](#supported-rules) and emit eslint warnings. If you want to be more strict, you can emit eslint errors by instead using `plugin:test-selectors/recommendedWithErrors`.

Another option: you can also selectively enable and disable individual rules in the `rules` section of your `.eslintrc` configuration. For instance, if you only want to enable the `test-selectors/button` rule, skip the `extends` addition above and simply add the following to the `rules` section of your `.eslintrc` configuration:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/button": ["warn", "always"]
    }
}
```

If you like most of the recommended rules by adding the `extends` option above, but find one in particular to be bothersome, you can simply disable it:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/anchor": "off"
    }
}
```

Note: see [Supported Rules](#supported-rules) below for a full list.

## Custom rule options

All tests can be customized individually by passing an object with one or more of the following properties.

### testAttribute

The default test attribute expected is `data-test-id`, but you can override it with whatever you like. Here is how you would use `data-some-custom-attribute` instead:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/onChange": ["warn", "always", { "testAttribute": "data-some-custom-attribute" }]
    }
}
```

Note: You can also pass multiple attributes

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/onChange": ["warn", "always", { "testAttribute": ["data-testid", "testId"] }]
    }
}
```

### ignoreDisabled

By default all elements with the `disabled` attribute are ignored, e.g. `<input disabled />`. If you don't want to ignore this attribute, set `ignoreDisabled` to `false`:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/onChange": ["warn", "always", { "ignoreDisabled": false }]
    }
}
```

### ignoreReadonly

By default all elements with the `readonly` attribute are ignored, e.g. `<input readonly />`. If you don't want to ignore this attribute, set `ignoreReadonly` to `false`:

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/onChange": ["warn", "always", { "ignoreReadonly": false }]
    }
}
```

### htmlOnly

Only supported on `button` rule, this option will exempt React components called Button from the rule.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "test-selectors/button": ["warn", "always", { "htmlOnly": true }]
    }
}
```

## Supported Rules

-   `test-selectors/anchor`
-   `test-selectors/button`
-   `test-selectors/input`
-   `test-selectors/onChange`
-   `test-selectors/onClick`
-   `test-selectors/onKeyDown`
-   `test-selectors/onKeyUp`
-   `test-selectors/onSubmit`

## Further Reading

If you don't want these test attributes added in production, you can use something like [babel-plugin-jsx-remove-data-test-id](https://github.com/coderas/babel-plugin-jsx-remove-data-test-id)
